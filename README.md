# JS-Weekly-Budget-App


hi in this project i used OOP in javascript

this project is about weekly budget app

if we try not to enter any value uses some condition and window.location.reload()

calculates the ramaining amount and print out 
and the cool thing is it changes its color when it reaches the 50% and 25% of the budget... 

when we enter expenses deatails it lists the expenses inside the card

quit a good project

the one of the harder projects i have done -- OOP concept

take a look into it...
